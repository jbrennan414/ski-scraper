- Tell Mark how to run this

Please add the following values to your .env file that you created.  
Mark can start the telegram bot for you so you can get your chat id by telling it 'hi'.  Once he figures 
out how to run it on the server it will be much more automated

`TELEGRAM_TOKEN=[THE BOT TOKEN GOES HERE]`
`MARK_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=[YOUR CHAT ID GOES HERE]`
`JOHN_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=[YOUR CHAT ID GOES HERE]`
